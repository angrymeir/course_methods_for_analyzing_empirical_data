    "### The Methods\n",
    "##### Parametric Methods\n",
    "Parametric methods are used to get specific knowledge about a population by estimating statistical parameters of a population. Those methods are called parametric, since they make assumptions about the characteristics of the variables. For example, the distribution of variables should be characterized by parameters (mean, standard deviation) - for instance normal distribtuion. Parametric methods are very efficient and also powerful for estimations or hypothesis testing if their assumptions are met. The following assumptions are generic. Individual parametric methods might rely on further assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumptions**  \n",
    "- Variables can be described by parametrized distribution\n",
    "- Variables should be continuous\n",
    "- Independence of observations\n",
    "- The data does not contain outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples**  \n",
    "- Pearson correlation coefficient\n",
    "- T-test\n",
    "- ANOVA\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Non-parametric Methods\n",
    "Non-parametric methods aim to counter the downsides (assumptions) of parametric methods. Hence, they make less assumptions about the data. However, this comes at the cost of statistical power, consequently less insights into the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumptions**  \n",
    "- The data is at least ordinal, or categorical\n",
    "- Independence of observations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples**  \n",
    "- Spearman correlation coefficient\n",
    "- Chi square test\n",
    "- Wilcoxon signed-rank test\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Comparison\n",
    "- Parametric methods are more powerful i.e. they are more likely to detect a true effect (e.g. statistical significance) because they employ (and assume) more statistical information than non-parametric methods\n",
    "- Parametric methods work better on small sample sizes than non-parametric methods as they use additional knowledge from the assumptions\n",
    "- Non-parametric methods work better if the assumptions of parametric methods are violated\n",
    "- Non-parametric methods often give less insights since they often mask the data (e.g. spearman correlation coefficient employs ranks instead of the exact values)"
